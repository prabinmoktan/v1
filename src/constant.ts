      'Coca-Cola Europacific Partners (CCEP) has recently revamped the taste of Fanta Orange Zero to better resemble the original Fanta Regular Orange flavor. The reformulated Fanta Orange Zero aims to appeal to the growing demand for zero sugar flavored carbonates. The new taste is supported by a bold packaging redesign across all Fanta flavors, featuring clearer differentiation between regular and zero sugar variants and bolder colors for maximum shelf impact. CCEP is investing heavily in sampling activity throughout the summer to showcase the improved taste and drive sales for retailers.',
